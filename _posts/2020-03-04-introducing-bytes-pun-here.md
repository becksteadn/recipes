Hello and welcome to my food blog! I hope to write about the successes and failures I have while experimenting in the kitchen, interesting tips and techniques, and anything else worth sharing.

I fell in love with cooking in college by watching Youtube creators like [Alex French Guy Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/user/FrenchGuyCooking) and [Bon Appetit](https://www.youtube.com/user/BonAppetitDotCom). I never wanted to eat the typical college dinner of microwave mac 'n cheese and pizza rolls. I spent my free time learning to bake bread, attempting to replicate [Gordon Ramsay's Pork Chop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke_xYIhYPTw), and perfecting pizza in a home oven.

I created a lot of delicious meals using my own understanding. There were no measurements. I added ingredients as the dish progressed into my idea of what the final product should be that night. As I ate, I regretted not recording my steps. Now I have a full-time job and my dream kitchen to myself. I can only imagine what's to come.
